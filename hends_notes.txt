My thought process as I go with this project: (my own logs XD)

- I want to download the datsets in code so anyone can just run the project direclty with ease.
I faced issues witht he robot dtatset link not working and retunrning 404 so I downloaded it manully 

- I also found the inside of the datasets is different so I had to load them in different ways.
the breast cancer dataset was the trickest and I had to study the structure and loop over it

- Made this project a repo 

- Preprocessing chapter:
I want to generilize the preprocssing as much as I can. 
    so far I can think of:
    - train_test_split
    - standardize
    - encode_labels


Glass -> Already numeric labels (1–7) but it's ok to encode them I think (not going to)
Energy -> We need to choose either Y1 or Y2 as a single regression target since each model expects one target variable 
Breast Cancer -> Label already converted to 0/1, features are numeric
> For those: I can (use labels as-is) so it's split -> standarize


Pump -> machine_status is a string (NORMAL, etc.) -> Needs encoding	-> use encode_labels()
Robot -> Label is a string (normal, collision, etc.) -> Needs encoding -> use encode_labels()
> For those: I can encode labels -> split -> standarize



Mushroom -> Needs full feature encoding	All features are strings! Definit need for encoding –> one-hot or label encoding
I'm against doing the encoding like ['a', 'b', 'c'] → [0, 1, 2] coz I don't like the idea that 2>0 so I'll go with one-hot and hope that I don't regret anything


------------------------

creating the models chapter:

>>>> logistic_regression
I'm thinking of the normal one of 2 classes and the the other one with multi-classes. 

The accuracy intially:
    - for the breast-cancer -> 92%  | lr=0.01, epochs=1000
    - for the glass -> 39.5%  | lr=0.01, epochs=1000
    - for pump -> ? |  lr=0.01, epochs=1000

Stop. with the pump, the way I wrote the MulticlassLogisticRegression with pure python took ages to train the pumps data. So I had to use numpy 
I feel I'm re inventing the wheel but it feels good to understand things in practice took

Moving on:
    - for the breast-cancer -> 92.98%  | lr=0.01, epochs=1000
    - for the glass -> 58.14%  | lr=0.005, epochs=3000
    - for pump -> 0.9878 |  lr=0.01, epochs=1000
    - for Mashroom -> 97.17%  | lr=0.01, epochs=1000
